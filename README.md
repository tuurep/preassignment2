Run:

* Install Python 3
* Install pip
* `pip install bottle`
* `python app.py`
* Go to `http://localhost:8080/`

By default you will see the package data of my Ubuntu system as it was on 16.2.2020.

If you're on Debian/Ubuntu, you can use your own system's data by passing `/var/lib/dpkg/status` (text file) to the `file_to_dict` method.
